abstract = {The vibrations of the electronic plasma are considered, which arose as a result of an arbitrary initial non-equilibrium distribution in it. It is shown that the vibrations of the field in plasma are always damped, and the dependence of the frequency and of the damping decrement an the wave vector is determined for small and for large values of the latter. The penetration of a periodical external electric field into the plasma is considered. The case of the frequency of the external field being almost at resonance with the proper frequency of plasma is considered separately.},

@article{Nagaoka2014,
abstract = {This paper gives an overview of collective effects that are likely to appear and possibly limit the performance in a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) that stores a high-intensity ultra-low-emittance beam. Beam instabilities and other intensity-dependent effects that may significantly impact the machine performance are covered. The latter include beam-induced machine heating, Touschek scattering, intra-beam scattering, as well as incoherent tune shifts. The general trend that the efforts to achieve ultra-low emittance result in increasing the machine coupling impedance and the beam sensitivity to instability is reviewed. The nature of coupling impedance in a DLSR is described, followed by a series of potentially dangerous beam instabilities driven by the former, such as resistive-wall, TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability), head-tail and microwave instabilities. In addition, beam-ion and CSR (coherent synchrotron radiation) instabilities are also treated. Means to fight against collective effects such as lengthening of the bunch with passive harmonic cavities and bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback are introduced. Numerical codes developed and used to evaluate the machine coupling impedance, as well as to simulate beam instability using the former as inputs are described.},

First, starting from the Bjorken-Mtingwa recipe, generalized formulae are derived for the three electro-magnetic intrabeam scattering growth rates, including non-ultrarelativistic terms and vertical dispersion, still maintaining a Gaussian beam approximation. A few applications to LHC and CLIC demonstrate the importance of the vertical dispersion. Other limitations of IBS theory are briefly discussed. Second, one of the these limitations is studied in more detail, namely the importance of nuclear scattering. Again estimates are presented for the LHC.},

@article{Feynman1949,
abstract = {In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown that a considerable simplification can be attained in writing down matrix elements for complex processes in electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives finite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons.The simplification in writing the expressions results from an emphasis on the over-all space-time view resulting from a study of the solution of the equations of electrodynamics. The relation of this to the more conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It would be very difficult to make the modification which is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in Hamiltonian form.The methods apply as well to charges obeying the Klein-Gordon equation, and to the various meson theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are given. Although a modification like that used in electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no longer true that all directly observable phenomena are insensitive to the details of the modification used.The actual evaluation of integrals appearing in the matrix elements may be facilitated, in the simpler cases, by methods described in the appendix.},

abstract = {Multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) appears because of Coulomb scattering of charged particles on each other. In hadron storage rings, it results in re-distribution of the energy between different degrees of freedom, growth of six-dimensional emittance, development of non-Gaussian tails in distribution function and sometimes to the loss of particles. Traditional method of IBS analysis is based on "Gaussian model", which is assumed that distribution functions are Gaussian ones for all degrees of freedom. The basic theorems derived from the Gaussian model are shortly discussed. More detailed IBS analysis can be done using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent tools. The FPE is written in "coordinate-momentum" space and in "invariant space" with account of the multiple IBS. Here, we consider two numerical methods of three-dimensional FPE solution developed at the last time: (1) the use of the "Langevin equations map" (LEM) and (2) the simulation of three-dimensional IBS using "the binary collision map" (BCM). The basics of both methods and examples of their application to storage rings are given. Alternative approach to the IBS analysis is named "molecular dynamics" (MD) based on the straight-forward integration of the particle trajectories taking into account the external electromagnetic fields and the Coulomb forces. Two modifications of MD are described: (1) a two-dimensional "wire model" and (2) a three-dimensional model of "periodical cells", which is fruitful in the case of small density beams, for example, the "crystalline beams". The basic problems of the molecular dynamics and results of its application to IBS analysis are shortly discussed. {\textcopyright}2007.},

abstract = {Multiple scattering of particles in a bunched beam by others in the same bunch can lead to continuous growth of the energy spread and/or one or both transverse emittances. Contrary to the first impression, for protons this growth becomes more rapid at higher energies due to an increasing unbalance of longitudinal and transverse temperatures. We calculate the growth-rates for particles in the SPS operated as pp collider, using existing formulae and an improved method to evaluate the required integrals. For nominal proton emittances, the fastest growth-time is almost 20 hours and will lead only to a slow decrease of luminosity. However, the smaller antiproton emittances could lead to a much faster growth unless they are blown up sufficiently. We also evaluate the intrabeam scattering of electrons (resp. positrons) for the SPS operated as LEP injector. For present pararemeters, the growth-times are always much longer than the damping times, and hence no adverse effects are expected for this mode of operation.},

Finally, applications to the large hadron collider 7TeV stored proton beam and the 'Extra LowEnergy Antiproton' (ELENA) 100 keV decelerated antiproton beam are used to illustrate the behaviour of the IBS growth rates, for a high-energy storage ring well above the transition energy and an ultra-low-energy decelerator ring below the transition energy.},

abstract = {For the kinetic analysis of multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) in storage rings the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent kinetic equations is needed. The exact solution of the FPE for a beam presented by a set of the macro-particles can be found using the "binary collision" model (BCM). However this method requires a large number of macro-particles ({\textgreater}104). Here we suggest a simple approximate method based on the following assumptions: (1) the friction force has a linear dependence on momentum; (2) the components of the diffusion tensor are constant. The friction coefficients and components of the diffusion tensor are chosen in order to provide the correct growth rates of the invariants describing the motion in storage rings. The integration over the distribution function (which is assumed to be Gaussian) is performed for strong focusing lattice according to the Bjorken-Mtingwa (BM) scheme. Change of the particle momentum is calculated using Langevin equations with account of correlation between the horizontal and longitudinal momentum changes. This algorithm allows us to present IBS effects as a "collective map" in the momentum space acting on each macro-particle. A numerical code using this algorithm is validated for the ITEP ring by comparing the BM code with results of the code based on the BCM algorithm. The algorithm allows including the IBS process in "turn by turn" macro-particle methods, which usually operate with a small number of macro-particles (about 100-1000). {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) appears because of Coulomb scattering of charged particles on each other. In hadron storage rings, it results in re-distribution of the energy between different degrees of freedom, growth of six-dimensional emittance, development of non-Gaussian tails in distribution function and sometimes to the loss of particles. Traditional method of IBS analysis is based on "Gaussian model", which is assumed that distribution functions are Gaussian ones for all degrees of freedom. The basic theorems derived from the Gaussian model are shortly discussed. More detailed IBS analysis can be done using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent tools. The FPE is written in "coordinate-momentum" space and in "invariant space" with account of the multiple IBS. Here, we consider two numerical methods of three-dimensional FPE solution developed at the last time: (1) the use of the "Langevin equations map" (LEM) and (2) the simulation of three-dimensional IBS using "the binary collision map" (BCM). The basics of both methods and examples of their application to storage rings are given. Alternative approach to the IBS analysis is named "molecular dynamics" (MD) based on the straight-forward integration of the particle trajectories taking into account the external electromagnetic fields and the Coulomb forces. Two modifications of MD are described: (1) a two-dimensional "wire model" and (2) a three-dimensional model of "periodical cells", which is fruitful in the case of small density beams, for example, the "crystalline beams". The basic problems of the molecular dynamics and results of its application to IBS analysis are shortly discussed. {\textcopyright}2007.},

abstract = {The latest generation of storage ring-based light sources employs multibend achromat lattices to achieve ultralow emittance. These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore, in such storage rings, parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are - unlike 3rd generation storage rings - no longer constant during a typical user shift. Instead, they depend on several varying parameters such as insertion device gap settings, bunch charge, bunch length, etc. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering in medium-energy storage rings with ultralow emittance becomes very strong. This creates a dependence of emittance on stored current. Furthermore, since the bunch length is adjusted with rf cavities but is also varied as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blowup from intrabeam scattering is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion with 6D tracking taking into account not only the bare lattice and rf cavity settings, but also momentary bunch charge and gap settings. Using the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as an example, this paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance storage ring as well as some implications for brightness optimization. {\textcopyright}Published by the American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This paper starts with an introduction to some elements of physical kinetics rel- evant to microscopic interactions in gas or plasma systems. The aim is to pro- vide the necessary background for understanding charged particle beams. Em- phasis is placed on the important role played by collisions in plasmas. We then give a detailed, albeit non-exhaustive, review of intrabeam scattering (IBS), which consists of the study of diffusion effects caused by multiple Coulomb scattering on charged particle beams, in both the transverse and the longitudi- nal beam dimensions. Finally, applications to the large hadron collider 7TeV stored proton beam and the 'Extra LowEnergy Antiproton' (ELENA) 100 keV decelerated antiproton beam are used to illustrate the behaviour of the IBS growth rates, for a high-energy storage ring well above the transition energy and an ultra-low-energy decelerator ring below the transition energy.},

abstract = {Using the Bjorken-Mtingwa formalism [1] we derive general expressions for the three intrabeam scattering (IBS) growth rates, including non-ultrarelativistic terms and ver- tical dispersion. These formulae have been implemented (and corrected) in the most recent version of MAD-X. An application to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) illus- trates the effect of crossing angles and detector fields on the vertical IBS growth rate. The IBS growth rates are also calculated for an LHC upgrade optics. A third exam- ple, from the damping ring of the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC), demonstrates the importance of the spurious vertical dispersion generated by orbit errors for the vertical IBS growth rate. Amodel of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) is used as a fourth example to demonstrate the importance of the spurious vertical dispersion for the vertical IBS growth rate in a regime where IBS is weak. Finally, some limitations of this approach to intrabeam scattering are discussed.},

abstract = {The addition of a higher harmonic RF system to the main system allows a control of the synchrotron frequency, the spread in synchrotron frequency and the bunch length. Adjustment of the higher harmonic system so as to reduce the slope of the RF wave to zero at the bunch centre leads to a longer bunch and a greatly increased spread in synchrotron frequency. This increases the Landau damping against: longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities. The motion of single particles in this highly non-linear potential is calculated numerically as well as analytically (by making some approximations). The dependence of the synchrotron frequency on amplitude and the forms of the synchrotron oscillations and the RF bucket are calculated. Finally the bunch shape and the distribution of particles in Qs are calculated for electron bunches.},

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

abstract = {For the kinetic analysis of multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) in storage rings the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent kinetic equations is needed. The exact solution of the FPE for a beam presented by a set of the macro-particles can be found using the "binary collision" model (BCM). However this method requires a large number of macro-particles ({\textgreater}104). Here we suggest a simple approximate method based on the following assumptions: (1) the friction force has a linear dependence on momentum; (2) the components of the diffusion tensor are constant. The friction coefficients and components of the diffusion tensor are chosen in order to provide the correct growth rates of the invariants describing the motion in storage rings. The integration over the distribution function (which is assumed to be Gaussian) is performed for strong focusing lattice according to the Bjorken-Mtingwa (BM) scheme. Change of the particle momentum is calculated using Langevin equations with account of correlation between the horizontal and longitudinal momentum changes. This algorithm allows us to present IBS effects as a "collective map" in the momentum space acting on each macro-particle. A numerical code using this algorithm is validated for the ITEP ring by comparing the BM code with results of the code based on the BCM algorithm. The algorithm allows including the IBS process in "turn by turn" macro-particle methods, which usually operate with a small number of macro-particles (about 100-1000). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The MAX IV 3GeV storage ring operates with beam of high current and ultralowemittance. These beam parameters in combination with the small effective aperture enhance possible collective beam instabilities. Three passive har- monic cavities are installed to introduce bunch lengthening and tune spread, leading to decoupling of the bunch spec- trum from the machine effective impedance and mitigating instabilities by Landau damping respectively. In this paper we present the first results of the commissioning of the pas- sive third harmonic cavities in theMAXIV 3GeV ring. The additional harmonic cavity potential significantly improved the beam lifetime. First observations of the harmonic cavity effect on the damping of collective beam instabilities are discussed.},

It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2$\nu$x or 2$\nu$z or $\nu$x + $\nu$z is integral, where $\nu$x and $\nu$z are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ $\nu$x Mc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

abstract = {The analysis of the evolution in phase space induced by multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) requires the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or of similar kinetic equations. The FPE is formulated in coordinate-momentum space (6 variables). Using the "semi-Gaussian model" this equation is reduced to the longitudinal FPE that depends on longitudinal momentum and coordinate; drift and diffusion coefficients in this equation are presented as integrals on distribution function with kernels expressed in analytical form. The number of variables in the FPE can be reduced to three by reformulation in the space of invariants. The invariant-vector has the following components: a longitudinal energy (for the longitudinal degree of freedom) and the Courant-Snyder invariants (for the transverse motion). The coefficients of the FPE in invariant space are in the form of integrals over the distribution function and the invariants with the kernel in the form of many-dimensional integrals over the longitudinal variable and over the oscillation phases. The three-dimensional FPE can be solved numerically by application of macro-particle codes using the different methods: 1) Langevin method; 2) binary collision map. The last method is used in the code "MOCAC" (MOnte CArlo Code) for IBS simulation. Examples of code validation and application are discussed. {\textcopyright}2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

abstract = {The analysis of the evolution in phase space induced by multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) requires the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or of similar kinetic equations. The FPE is formulated in coordinate-momentum space (6 variables). Using the "semi-Gaussian model" this equation is reduced to the longitudinal FPE that depends on longitudinal momentum and coordinate; drift and diffusion coefficients in this equation are presented as integrals on distribution function with kernels expressed in analytical form. The number of variables in the FPE can be reduced to three by reformulation in the space of invariants. The invariant-vector has the following components: a longitudinal energy (for the longitudinal degree of freedom) and the Courant-Snyder invariants (for the transverse motion). The coefficients of the FPE in invariant space are in the form of integrals over the distribution function and the invariants with the kernel in the form of many-dimensional integrals over the longitudinal variable and over the oscillation phases. The three-dimensional FPE can be solved numerically by application of macro-particle codes using the different methods: 1) Langevin method; 2) binary collision map. The last method is used in the code "MOCAC" (MOnte CArlo Code) for IBS simulation. Examples of code validation and application are discussed. {\textcopyright}2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.In an electron storage ring, the interaction between a single-bunch beam and a vacuum chamber impedance affects the beam parameters, which can be measured rather precisely. So we can develop beam-based numerical models of longitudinal and transverse impedances. At the Diamond Light Source (DLS) to get the model parameters, a set of measured data has been used including current-dependent shift of betatron tunes and synchronous phase, chromatic damping rates, and bunch lengthening. A matlab code for multiparticle tracking has been developed. The tracking results and analytical estimations are quite consistent with the measured data. Since Diamond has the shortest natural bunch length among all light sources in standard operation, the studies of collective effects with short bunches are relevant to many facilities including next generation of light sources.},

abstract = {The latest generation of storage ring-based light sources employs multibend achromat lattices to achieve ultralow emittance. These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore, in such storage rings, parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are - unlike 3rd generation storage rings - no longer constant during a typical user shift. Instead, they depend on several varying parameters such as insertion device gap settings, bunch charge, bunch length, etc. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering in medium-energy storage rings with ultralow emittance becomes very strong. This creates a dependence of emittance on stored current. Furthermore, since the bunch length is adjusted with rf cavities but is also varied as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blowup from intrabeam scattering is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion with 6D tracking taking into account not only the bare lattice and rf cavity settings, but also momentary bunch charge and gap settings. Using the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as an example, this paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance storage ring as well as some implications for brightness optimization. {\textcopyright}Published by the American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The addition of a higher harmonic RF system to the main system allows a control of the synchrotron frequency, the spread in synchrotron frequency and the bunch length. Adjustment of the higher harmonic system so as to reduce the slope of the RF wave to zero at the bunch centre leads to a longer bunch and a greatly increased spread in synchrotron frequency. This increases the Landau damping against: longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities. The motion of single particles in this highly non-linear potential is calculated numerically as well as analytically (by making some approximations). The dependence of the synchrotron frequency on amplitude and the forms of the synchrotron oscillations and the RF bucket are calculated. Finally the bunch shape and the distribution of particles in Qs are calculated for electron bunches.},

abstract = {The analysis of the evolution in phase space induced by multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) requires the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or of similar kinetic equations. The FPE is formulated in coordinate-momentum space (6 variables). Using the "semi-Gaussian model" this equation is reduced to the longitudinal FPE that depends on longitudinal momentum and coordinate; drift and diffusion coefficients in this equation are presented as integrals on distribution function with kernels expressed in analytical form. The number of variables in the FPE can be reduced to three by reformulation in the space of invariants. The invariant-vector has the following components: a longitudinal energy (for the longitudinal degree of freedom) and the Courant-Snyder invariants (for the transverse motion). The coefficients of the FPE in invariant space are in the form of integrals over the distribution function and the invariants with the kernel in the form of many-dimensional integrals over the longitudinal variable and over the oscillation phases. The three-dimensional FPE can be solved numerically by application of macro-particle codes using the different methods: 1) Langevin method; 2) binary collision map. The last method is used in the code "MOCAC" (MOnte CArlo Code) for IBS simulation. Examples of code validation and application are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Leemann2014,
abstract = {The latest generation of storage ring-based light sources employs multibend achromat lattices to achieve ultralow emittance. These lattices make use of a large number of weak bending magnets which considerably reduces the amount of power radiated in the dipoles in comparison to power radiated from insertion devices. Therefore, in such storage rings, parameters such as emittance, energy spread, and radiated power are - unlike 3rd generation storage rings - no longer constant during a typical user shift. Instead, they depend on several varying parameters such as insertion device gap settings, bunch charge, bunch length, etc. Since the charge per bunch is usually high, intrabeam scattering in medium-energy storage rings with ultralow emittance becomes very strong. This creates a dependence of emittance on stored current. Furthermore, since the bunch length is adjusted with rf cavities but is also varied as insertion device gaps change, the emittance blowup from intrabeam scattering is not constant either. Therefore, the emittance, bunch length, and hence the resulting Touschek lifetime have to be calculated in a self-consistent fashion with 6D tracking taking into account not only the bare lattice and rf cavity settings, but also momentary bunch charge and gap settings. Using the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring as an example, this paper demonstrates the intricate interplay between transverse emittance (insertion devices, emittance coupling), longitudinal emittance (tuning of main cavities as well as harmonic cavities), and choice of stored current in an ultralow-emittance storage ring as well as some implications for brightness optimization. {\textcopyright} Published by the American Physical Society.},

First, starting from the Bjorken-Mtingwa recipe, generalized formulae are derived for the three electro-magnetic intrabeam scattering growth rates, including non-ultrarelativistic terms and vertical dispersion, still maintaining a Gaussian beam approximation. A few applications to LHC and CLIC demonstrate the importance of the vertical dispersion. Other limitations of IBS theory are briefly discussed. Second, one of the these limitations is studied in more detail, namely the importance of nuclear scattering. Again estimates are presented for the LHC.},

abstract = {For the kinetic analysis of multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) in storage rings the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent kinetic equations is needed. The exact solution of the FPE for a beam presented by a set of the macro-particles can be found using the "binary collision" model (BCM). However this method requires a large number of macro-particles ({\textgreater}104). Here we suggest a simple approximate method based on the following assumptions: (1) the friction force has a linear dependence on momentum; (2) the components of the diffusion tensor are constant. The friction coefficients and components of the diffusion tensor are chosen in order to provide the correct growth rates of the invariants describing the motion in storage rings. The integration over the distribution function (which is assumed to be Gaussian) is performed for strong focusing lattice according to the Bjorken-Mtingwa (BM) scheme. Change of the particle momentum is calculated using Langevin equations with account of correlation between the horizontal and longitudinal momentum changes. This algorithm allows us to present IBS effects as a "collective map" in the momentum space acting on each macro-particle. A numerical code using this algorithm is validated for the ITEP ring by comparing the BM code with results of the code based on the BCM algorithm. The algorithm allows including the IBS process in "turn by turn" macro-particle methods, which usually operate with a small number of macro-particles (about 100-1000). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present the multibunch tracking code mbtrack developed to simulate, in 6-dimensional phase space, single- and multibunch collective instabilities driven by short- and long-range wakefields in storage rings. Multiple bunches, each composed of a large number of macroparticles, are tracked, allowing simulation of both intra- and interbunch motions. Besides analytical impedance models, the code allows employment of numerical wake potentials computed with electromagnetic (EM) field solvers. The corresponding impedances are fitted to a number of known analytical functions and the coefficients obtained in the fit are used as an input to the code. mbtrack performs a dynamic treatment of long-range resistive-wall and harmonic cavity fields, which are likely to be the two major factors impacting multibunch collective motions in many present and future ring-based light sources. Furthermore, it is capable of simulating beam-ion interactions as well as transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback. We describe the physical effects considered in the code and their implementation, which makes use of parallel processing to significantly shorten the computation time. mbtrack is benchmarked against other codes and applied to the MAX IV 3GeV ring as an example, where the importance of the interplay of various physical effects as well as coupling among different degrees of freedom is demonstrated.},

So we can develop beam-based numerical models of longitudinal and transverse impedances. At the Diamond Light Source (DLS) to get the model parameters, a set of measured data has been used including current-dependent shift of betatron tunes and synchronous phase, chromatic damping rates, and bunch lengthening. A matlab code for multiparticle tracking has been developed. The tracking results and analytical estimations are quite consistent with the measured data. Since Diamond has the shortest natural bunch length among all light sources in standard operation, the studies of collective effects with short bunches are relevant to many facilities including next generation of light sources.},

abstract = {Multiple scattering of particles in a bunched beam by others in the same bunch can lead to continuous growth of the energy spread and/or one or both transverse emittances. Contrary to the first impression, for protons this growth becomes more rapid at higher energies due to an increasing unbalance of longitudinal and transverse temperatures. We calculate the growth-rates for particles in the SPS operated as pp collider, using existing formulae and an improved method to evaluate the required integrals. For nominal proton emittances, the fastest growth-time is almost 20 hours and will lead only to a slow decrease of luminosity. However, the smaller antiproton emittances could lead to a much faster growth unless they are blown up sufficiently. We also evaluate the intrabeam scattering of electrons (resp. positrons) for the SPS operated as LEP injector. For present pararemeters, the growth-times are always much longer than the damping times, and hence no adverse effects are expected for this mode of operation.},

abstract = {The MAX IV storage rings, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, will use third harmonic cavities operated passively to lengthen the bunches and alleviate collective instabilities. These cavities are an essential ingredient in the MAX IV design concept and are required for achieving the final design goals in terms of stored current, beam emittance, and beam lifetime—such performance challenges are in fact common to all recent ultralow emittance storage ring designs and harmonic cavities are currently under consideration in several laboratories. In this paper, we report on parametric studies comparing different harmonic cavity settings in terms of the resulting bunch length, peak bunch density, and incoherent synchrotron frequency spread for the MAX IV 3 GeV ring. The equilibrium longitudinal bunch density distribution was calculated by establishing a self-consistent equation for the bunch form factor, describing the bunch shape. The calculations are fully self-consistent in the sense that not only the amplitude but also the phase of the waves excited by the beam in the harmonic cavity were assumed to be a function of the bunch shape, which allowed us to explore a wide parameter range not restricted to the region close to the conditions for which the first and second derivatives of the total rf voltage are zero at the synchronous phase. Our results indicate that up to a factor 5 increase in rms bunch length is achievable with a purely passive system for theMAXIV 3 GeV ring while keeping a relatively large harmonic cavity detuning, thus limiting the unavoidable Robinson antidamping rate from the fundamental mode of a passively operated harmonic cavity to values below the synchrotron radiation damping rate. The paper is complemented by results of measurements performed in the MAX III storage ring, which showed good agreement with calculations following the fully self-consistent approach.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of collective effects that are likely to appear and possibly limit the performance in a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) that stores a high-intensity ultra-low-emittance beam. Beam instabilities and other intensity-dependent effects that may significantly impact the machine performance are covered. The latter include beam-induced machine heating, Touschek scattering, intra-beam scattering, as well as incoherent tune shifts. The general trend that the efforts to achieve ultra-low emittance result in increasing the machine coupling impedance and the beam sensitivity to instability is reviewed. The nature of coupling impedance in a DLSR is described, followed by a series of potentially dangerous beam instabilities driven by the former, such as resistive-wall, TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability), head-tail and microwave instabilities. In addition, beam-ion and CSR (coherent synchrotron radiation) instabilities are also treated. Means to fight against collective effects such as lengthening of the bunch with passive harmonic cavities and bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback are introduced. Numerical codes developed and used to evaluate the machine coupling impedance, as well as to simulate beam instability using the former as inputs are described.},

abstract = {This paper starts with an introduction to some elements of physical kinetics rel- evant to microscopic interactions in gas or plasma systems. The aim is to pro- vide the necessary background for understanding charged particle beams. Em- phasis is placed on the important role played by collisions in plasmas. We then give a detailed, albeit non-exhaustive, review of intrabeam scattering (IBS), which consists of the study of diffusion effects caused by multiple Coulomb scattering on charged particle beams, in both the transverse and the longitudi- nal beam dimensions. Finally, applications to the large hadron collider 7TeV stored proton beam and the 'Extra LowEnergy Antiproton' (ELENA) 100 keV decelerated antiproton beam are used to illustrate the behaviour of the IBS growth rates, for a high-energy storage ring well above the transition energy and an ultra-low-energy decelerator ring below the transition energy.},

@article{Zenkevich2007,
abstract = {Multiple intra-beam scattering (IBS) appears because of Coulomb scattering of charged particles on each other. In hadron storage rings, it results in re-distribution of the energy between different degrees of freedom, growth of six-dimensional emittance, development of non-Gaussian tails in distribution function and sometimes to the loss of particles. Traditional method of IBS analysis is based on "Gaussian model", which is assumed that distribution functions are Gaussian ones for all degrees of freedom. The basic theorems derived from the Gaussian model are shortly discussed. More detailed IBS analysis can be done using the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) or equivalent tools. The FPE is written in "coordinate-momentum" space and in "invariant space" with account of the multiple IBS. Here, we consider two numerical methods of three-dimensional FPE solution developed at the last time: (1) the use of the "Langevin equations map" (LEM) and (2) the simulation of three-dimensional IBS using "the binary collision map" (BCM). The basics of both methods and examples of their application to storage rings are given. Alternative approach to the IBS analysis is named "molecular dynamics" (MD) based on the straight-forward integration of the particle trajectories taking into account the external electromagnetic fields and the Coulomb forces. Two modifications of MD are described: (1) a two-dimensional "wire model" and (2) a three-dimensional model of "periodical cells", which is fruitful in the case of small density beams, for example, the "crystalline beams". The basic problems of the molecular dynamics and results of its application to IBS analysis are shortly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = "The measured response matrix giving the change in orbit at beam position monitors (BPMs) with changes in steering magnet excitation can be used to accurately calibrate the linear optics in an electron storage ring [1–8]. A computer code called LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) was developed to analyze the NSLS X-Ray Ring measured response matrix to determine: the gradients in all 56 quadrupole magnets; the calibration of the steering magnets and BPMs; the roll of the quadrupoles, steering magnets, and BPMs about the electron beam direction; the longitudinal magnetic centers of the orbit steering magnets; the horizontal dispersion at the orbit steering magnets; and the transverse mis-alignment of the electron orbit in each of the sextupoles. Random orbit measurement error from the BPMs propagated to give only 0.04\% rms error in the determination of individual quadrupole gradients and 0.4 mrad rms error in the determination of individual quadrupole rolls. Small variations of a few parts in a thousand in the quadrupole gradients within an individual family were resolved. The optics derived by LOCO gave accurate predictions of the horizontal dispersion, the beta functions, and the horizontal and vertical emittances, and it gave good qualitative agreement with the measured vertical dispersion. The improved understanding of the X-Ray Ring has enabled us to increase the synchrotron radiation brightness. The LOCO code can also be used to find the quadrupole family gradients that best correct for gradient errors in quadrupoles, in sextupoles, and from synchrotron radiation insertion devices. In this way the design periodicity of a storage ring's optics can be restored. An example of periodicity restoration will be presented for the NSLS VUV Ring. LOCO has also produced useful results when applied to the ALS storage ring [8]."
